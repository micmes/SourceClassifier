Welcome to fermitool's documentation!
=====================================

SourceClassifier is a package capable to perform data analysis and to visualize the given dataset in a graphical fashion. More specifically, this tool allows the user to build histogram and map the sources of Fermi 4FGL catalog: in addition, it provides a method to infer the class of the sources that are not identified or associated yet, through the using of ML decision tree techniques.
For this purpose, we built a class *Fermi_Dataset*, whose features are described below.
